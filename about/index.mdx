## Projects
### Imperial Archive
The Imperial Archive is a detailed repository of information pertaining to the Universe of Avilium. This project is not in-character and the information found on the archive website may contain several spoilers to stories that have not yet been published or plot points that have not be publicly revealed by other projects. The information on the archive should be considered the ultimate canon of Avilium, but is subject to change as the universe evolves over time. Major plot changes will be explained in every applicable content release.

The archive website is currently under development.

### Ao3 Stories
While this isn't necessarily a formal project, we encourage community members to participate in the growth and development of Avilium by writing and publishing stories on Ao3. Note that stories on Ao3 should not be considered canon unless corroborated by information found on the Imperial Archive. To read through our Ao3 stories, visit the [Avinadal Ao3 Collection](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/avilium).

### Public Data Trust
The Public Data Trust (PDT) is a website with content written with the assistance of AI tools pertaining to the Universe of Avilium. We use Perplexity to generate immersive, official looking content that reveals lore details through the lens of an in-universe propoganda machine. We use Gemini to generate "blog" articles and content for the site to intentionally include a satirically uncanny valley, human-adjacent feel to the writing. Both tools are fed canon details about the universe to generate specific content. The PDT website is not intended to drive any revenue for Avinadal. 

Without revealing specific spoilers, the PDT website is intended to be filled with a variety of easter eggs that reveal even more lore. The plans for the website include adding more of these easter eggs to expand the ARG-oriented lore delivery.

### U.L.M.I.N.A.
ULMINA, or Ulmina, is an internal AI project to craft a lore-oriented AI bot that is capable of answering questions and explaining complex topics about the Universe of Avilium. The Ulmina project is also used to review and analyze the contents of the Imperial Archives to call out any potential conflicts between updates.

## Support
Our community is always looking for new members, whether new content creators, fans and supporters, or people who want to join a group of like-minded individuals, even if content creation doesn't mainly fall into their interests.

Support via the [Avinadal Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/c/Avinadal) is always appreciated, but you can also try joining the [Avinadal Discord server](https://discord.gg/avinadal), introducing yourself, and interacting with the community as you are able.

## Our Views on AI
While we do use AI chat bots for PDT and are building our own AI for ULMINA, we are extremely watchful and prefer to be careful with our approach to using AI. At this time, we have no intentions of embracing AI for content creation outside of the PDT use which, without spoilers, is *meant* to come across like it is AI-generated.
