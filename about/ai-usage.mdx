Avinadal is a generally pro-AI organization, however we are not AI-dependent. We strictly use AI as a tool to fill the gaps in our own skillsets and knowledge. Any content AI-generated content released or published by Avinadal is done so completely for free to the public. Avinadal commits to ensure that any profits earned from AI-generated content will be donated to charity.

## MÆJESTY
MÆJESTY is a music-oriented community project utilizing AI tools such as Gemini, ChatGPT, Suno.ai, and NovelAI to assist in the creation and development of musical content revolving around the lore of the Universe of Avilium. MÆJESTY is primarily a project worked on by and for our own community, allowing us to work within a motivational loop, generating music driven by our lore to keep ourselves motivated and inspired to continue working on that lore.

We use Amuse.io to distribute MÆJESTY's music, allowing us to deliver the musical content to our community members regardless of what music platform they use. We also provide direct downloads of the files to community members who prefer not to use music streaming services.

We do not have any intention of making money or seeing any profits from MÆJESTY content, but commit to ensuring that any and all profits will be donated to charity if ever realized.

## Public Data Trust
The Public Data Trust (PDT) is a website with content written with the assistance of AI tools pertaining to the Universe of Avilium. We use Perplexity to generate immersive, official looking content that reveals lore details through the lens of an in-universe propoganda machine. We use Gemini to generate "blog" articles and content for the site to intentionally include a satirically uncanny valley, human-adjacent feel to the writing. Both tools are fed canon details about the universe to generate specific content. The PDT website is not intended to drive any revenue for Avinadal. 

Without revealing specific spoilers, the PDT website is intended to be filled with a variety of easter eggs that reveal even more lore. The plans for the website include adding more of these easter eggs to expand the ARG-oriented lore delivery.
